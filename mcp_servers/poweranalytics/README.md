# PowerAnalytics MCP Server

This MCP server enables an LLM to interact with **PowerAnalytics.jl** — a Julia package
for analyzing power system simulation results generated by PowerSimulations.jl.

PowerAnalytics runs locally via the Julia REPL (no remote API calls). The server exposes
tools, resources, and prompts that allow the LLM to generate Julia scripts, execute them,
and interpret the results on behalf of the user.

> **Status:** Skeleton — tools, resources, and prompts are not yet implemented.

## How to run and use the MCP server

- Open the MCP extension in your editor and go to **MCP: List Servers**.
- Choose the **poweranalytics** server and click **Start Server** if it is not already running.
- If you modify any server code (for example `poweranalytics.py`), select the server again
  and click **Restart Server** to pick up the changes.

## Prerequisites

- **Julia** must be installed and available on PATH (or configure `JULIA_EXECUTABLE` in
  `poweranalytics.py`).
- **PowerAnalytics.jl** must be installed / available in the target Julia project environment.

## Using the tools from the LLM chat

- Ask questions in the LLM chat (for example: "Get the generation time series for each
  thermal component in the system").
- The LLM will use the MCP tools to activate the Julia project, generate and run a script
  using the PowerAnalytics.jl public API, and return the results with an explanation.
- When a tool is invoked, the assistant will request permission within the chat session
  before using it.

## Troubleshooting

- If Julia is not found, verify it is on your PATH or update `JULIA_EXECUTABLE` in
  `poweranalytics.py`.
- If tools return error messages, restart the `poweranalytics` server and re-run the query.

## Development notes

- Main server file: `poweranalytics.py` (defines MCP server, tools, resources, prompts).
- Entry point: `main.py` (imports and calls `main()` from `poweranalytics.py`).
- Dependency manifest: `pyproject.toml`.
